# महाकाव्य :
Amazed by such sacred shlokas that are beyond the present material science. I tried gathering some of them just to admire the presence of *krishna* (pure consciousness). 
```
ॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात् पूर्णमुदच्यते।
पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते॥
                          -वृहदारण्यक उपनिषद
```
The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad *(part of Advaita vedanta)* is 14 kānda of Śatapatha Brāhmana means great wilderness. It is a disquisition on Ātman (Self), includes passages on metaphysics,
concept of Space and Time continuum, ethics and urge for aquisition of knowledge.

-It states that 

**"What is visible is the infinite. What is invisible is also the infinite. Out of the Infinite Being the finite has come, yet being infinite, only infinite remains."**
